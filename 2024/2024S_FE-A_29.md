Which of the following is a public-key cryptography algorithm whose security depends on the difficulty of factoring extremely large numbers into primes?
a) AES 
b) DH 
c) DSA 
d) RSA
? 
d) RSA
### ### Explanation

**RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)** is a widely used **public-key cryptography algorithm** that relies on the mathematical challenge of factoring large numbers into their prime factors. The security of RSA is based on the fact that while multiplying two large prime numbers is computationally simple, factoring their product back into the original primes is extremely difficult, especially when the numbers are very large. This is known as the **integer factorization problem**, and it is the foundation of RSA's encryption and key exchange mechanisms.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**:

- **AES** is a **symmetric encryption algorithm**, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. AES relies on complex mathematical transformations for security, but it does not depend on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.

**b) DH (Diffie-Hellman)**:

- **Diffie-Hellman** is a **key exchange protocol** that allows two parties to securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel. Its security relies on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem, not on factoring large numbers.

**c) DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)**:

- **DSA** is a **digital signature algorithm** used for verifying the authenticity and integrity of a message. Its security is based on the discrete logarithm problem, not on factoring large numbers into primes.
