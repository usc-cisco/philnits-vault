# 2024S_FE-A_56 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

Which of the following is the maximum value of Z from the constraints that are shown
below?
x + y ≤4
x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0
Z= 3x + 4y
a) 12 
b) 14 
c) 16 
d) 18
? 
c) 16 
### Solve
Re-arrange so we get the value of y
y ≤ 4 - x

Substitute y in the Z equation
Z = 3x + 4(4 - x)
Z = 3x + 16 - 4x

Z = 16 - x
So we get this equation above.
We can see that Z decreases as x increases.
To maximize Z (from problem specs) we decrease x as much as we can.

From the definition, we can see x ≥ 0, so the minimum value is 0.

So substitute that
Z = 16 - 0
Z = 16

### Or Simply Trial & Error
This is what I did first before I had to make my own solution for you guys to understand this flashcard 💀

I started with x = 0, y = 0, and work your way up until you have done every combination.
This is okay since the maximum values of x and y isn't that big.
