# 2024S_FE-A_2 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

Five people are sitting at a table in a restaurant. Two of them ordered coffee, and the other three ordered tea. The waiter forgets who ordered what and puts the drinks in a random order for the five persons. What is the probability that every person gets the correct drink?

a) $\frac{1}{30}$
b) $\frac{1}{20}$
c) $\frac{1}{10}$
d) $\frac{3}{10}$
?
**Answer: C**
### Step 1: List down the given

Given:

5 people,
2 coffee orders, 
3 tea orders 
### Step 2: Calculate the probability

To calculate probability, you must **divide the number of favorable events by the total number of possible events**. 

*Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes*

Using the formula above, it would be possible to calculate for the final answer using the values for either tea or coffee being served to the correct people. Since in the case that either one of them is served correctly, then the other will also be the same.

Calculating for P, probability, using the values for coffee:

$P = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{20} = 0.1$

Using the values for tea:

$P = \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{2}{4} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6}{60} = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1$
