Which of the following is a package of unauthorized programs and tools that has functions such as creating a backdoor on a server and hiding the evidence of intrusion inside the server?
a) RFID 
b) Rootkit 
c) TKIP 
d) Web beacon
? 
b) Rootkit 
### Explanation

A **rootkit** is a collection of malicious programs and tools designed to allow unauthorized access to a computer system while concealing its presence. It typically has the following characteristics:

- **Backdoor creation**: Rootkits often include a backdoor that enables an attacker to remotely access the compromised system without the user’s knowledge.
- **Hiding evidence**: Rootkits are designed to hide their existence and any traces of intrusion, such as logs or processes, making it difficult for the system owner to detect the attack.
- **Stealth and persistence**: Rootkits operate in stealth mode and can sometimes survive system reboots or even reinstallations of the operating system.

### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)**:

- **RFID** is a technology used for wireless communication between a reader and a tag using radio waves. It is used for identification and tracking of objects (e.g., in supply chains, passports), not for creating backdoors or hiding evidence of intrusions.

**c) TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)**:

- **TKIP** is an encryption protocol used to secure wireless networks, particularly in older Wi-Fi security standards like WPA. It is unrelated to malicious software or tools for hiding evidence of intrusion.

**d) Web beacon**:

- A **web beacon** is a small, often invisible image file or script embedded in a web page or email, used to track user activity, such as whether an email was opened or a webpage was visited. It is primarily a tracking tool and does not involve creating backdoors or hiding evidence of intrusions.
