Which of the following is an encryption method that can be used for encrypting data managed in a database using the same key for encryption and decryption?

a) AES 
b) PKI 
c) RSA 
d) SHA-256
? 
a) AES 
### Explanation

**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** is a **symmetric encryption method**, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. It is widely used for encrypting data, including data stored in databases, due to its efficiency and security. AES is considered very strong and is commonly used in securing sensitive information.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**b) PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**:

- **PKI** is not an encryption method itself, but a framework that uses **asymmetric encryption** (e.g., RSA) to manage public and private keys. Asymmetric encryption uses different keys for encryption and decryption, which is different from what the question is asking.

**c) RSA**:

- **RSA** is an **asymmetric encryption method**, meaning it uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is not suitable for encrypting large amounts of data like in databases, and it does not use the same key for both encryption and decryption.

**d) SHA-256**:

- **SHA-256** is a **hashing algorithm**, not an encryption method. It is used to generate a fixed-size hash value from data, but it does not provide encryption or decryption capabilities.
