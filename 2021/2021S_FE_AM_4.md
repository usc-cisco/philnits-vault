To compare the entrance exams of the current and previous years, a company required many of its employees to take those exams. The correlation coefficient and the regression line were obtained by assigning the scores of the previous year to the x-axis and the scores of the current year to the y-axis. Which of the following can be derived from the results below?

`[`Results`]`
	The correlation coefficient is 0.8.
	The slope of the regression line is 1.1.
	The y-intercept of the regression line is 10.

a) From the slope and the y-intercept of the regression line, the tendency is to obtain a higher score for the current year than the previous year
b) From the slope of the regression line and the correlation coefficient, the exam of the current year is of high quality.
c) From the slope of the regression line, the average score for the current year is 1.1 times that of the previous year.
d) From the y-intercept of regression line, those who get zero for the current year can get a score as high as 10 for the previous year.

a) From the slope and the y-intercept of the regression line, the tendency is to obtain a higher score for the current year than the previous year
### Step 1: Gather important details.

1) correlation coefficient
2) regression line
3) scores of previous year = x-axis
4) scores of current year = y-axis

### Step 2: Interpret details and results.

#### Details
1) correlation coefficient 
	- tells us about how related the two variables, `x` and `y` are
	- $1$ = perfectly correlated (if x goes up, y goes up, and vice versa)
	- $0$ = zero correlation
	- $-1$ = perfect negative correlation (if x goes up, y goes down, and vice versa)

2) regression line
	- tells us the relationship between the two variables
	- applied in scenarios where the change of the independent variable (x) changes the dependent variable (y)

#### Results
1) The correlation coefficient is 0.8. 
	-  based on the description of correlation coefficients this means that the two variables x and y are `near perfect correlation` 
2) The slope of the regression line is 1.1.
	- the rate of change per increase of `x` is that for every 1 point in x means 1.1 points in y
	- so as the score of the previous year increases, scores of the current year increase more
	- `an increasing trend`
3) The y-intercept of the regression line is 10.
	- if `x` = 0, then, the `y`-axis starts at 10
	- meaning if someone in the previous year `x` scores 0, it is expected that they would get 10 in the current year `y`
### Step 3: Compare analysis to the choices

#### a) From the slope and the y-intercept of the regression line, the tendency is to obtain a higher score for the current year than the previous year
- from the analyses of both the slope and y-intercept of the regression line, the statement coincides
#### b) From the slope of the regression line and the correlation coefficient, the exam of the current year is of high quality.
- high quality isn't defined or studied in the problem, rather, it is the scores that are being compared
#### c) From the slope of the regression line, the average score for the current year is 1.1 times that of the previous year.
- the slope doesn't talk about the overall average score, instead it talks about each individual score. (1 point of x is 1.1 points for y)
#### d) From the y-intercept of regression line, those who get zero for the current year can get a score as high as 10 for the previous year.
- the variables are reversed, remember [[#Step 2 Interpret details and results.|step 2]]
	- current year = y-axis
	- previous year = x-axis
- it should be that if the person's score in the previous year is 0, in the current year that person should get an expected 10 points

### Therefore, the answer is **a)**
