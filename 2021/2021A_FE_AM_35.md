a) Applying appropriate controls to lower a risk

? 
b) Discontinuing some operations that have a risk c) Knowingly and objectively not taking any action on a risk 
### Explanation

**Risk avoidance** involves completely eliminating the risk by deciding not to engage in the activity that generates it. In this case, **discontinuing some operations that have a risk** is an example of risk avoidance because the organization decides to stop the risky activity altogether, thereby avoiding the potential threat.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) Applying appropriate controls to lower a risk**:

- This describes **risk reduction**, where measures are taken to lower the likelihood or impact of a risk. The risk still exists, but its potential damage is minimized.

**c) Knowingly and objectively not taking any action on a risk**:

- This describes **risk acceptance**, where the risk is acknowledged, but no specific action is taken to mitigate it, often because the risk is deemed acceptable or too costly to address.

**d) Transferring a risk to other parties**:

- This describes **risk sharing (or risk transfer)**, which involves shifting the risk to a third party, such as by purchasing insurance or outsourcing certain operations. The risk remains, but another party bears the responsibility.
