In system development, when the relationship between person-months and the duration (months) is represented in the approximate expression shown below, and the total person-month is 4096, how many months does it take? 

Duration = 2.5 $\times$ $person-months^\frac{^1}{3}$ 

a) 16
b) 40 
c) 64 
d) 160
? 
b) 40 
### Explanation

To find the duration in months, we are given the formula:

Duration = 2.5 $\times$ $person-months^\frac{^1}{3}$ 

And the total person-months is 4096. Let's calculate the duration step by step:

Duration = 2.5 $\times$ $(4096)^\frac{^1}{3}$ 

1. First, calculate the cube root of 4096:

 $(4096)^\frac{^1}{3}$ = 16

2. Now multiply the result by 2.5:

Duration =  2.5 $\times$ 16 = 40

Therefore, the duration is **40 months**.
