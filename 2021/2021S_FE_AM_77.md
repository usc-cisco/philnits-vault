In a sampling inspection, which of the following can be used to ascertain the probability of acceptance of a lot with a certain defective ratio?

a) Bathtub curve
b) Gompertz curve
c) Logistic curve
d) OC curve
?
c) 291.25
## Explanation

### Option a)
- commonly used in reliability engineering
- represent the failure rates of products over time
- typically showing:
	- the phases of infant mortality,
	- normal life,
	- and wear-out

### Option b)
- often used in modeling growth processes
- can describe populations, but it is not specifically used for acceptance sampling
### Option c)
- related to growth models and can be used to describe probabilities
- not specifically used for acceptance sampling

### Option d) (ANSWER)
- effectively illustrates the relationship between the probability of acceptance and the proportion of defective items in a lot
