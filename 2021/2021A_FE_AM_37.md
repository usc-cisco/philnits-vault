Biometric authentication includes a verification method that extracts physical characteristics and another verification method that extracts behavioral characteristics. Which of the following is the method that uses behavioral characteristics?

a) Performing authentication by extracting characteristics from pen speed and pressure when a signature is provided 
b) Performing authentication by extracting characteristics from the bifurcation angle of the bifurcation point of a blood vessel or from the distance between adjacent bifurcation points 
c) Performing authentication by extracting the characteristic point called minutia from the pattern formed by ridges 
d) Performing authentication by extracting the characteristics of chaotic wrinkles in the eye from the pupil to the outside
? 
a) Performing authentication by extracting characteristics from pen speed and pressure when a signature is provided 
### Explanation

**Behavioral characteristics** in biometric authentication are based on the way an individual performs certain actions, such as typing patterns or handwriting. **Option a**, which involves the examination of characteristics from **pen speed and pressure when a signature is provided**, is an example of a behavioral biometric method because it focuses on how the person signs their name, rather than how their handwriting looks like.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**b) Performing authentication by extracting characteristics from the bifurcation angle of the bifurcation point of a blood vessel or from the distance between adjacent bifurcation points**:

- This describes **vascular pattern recognition**, a **physical characteristic** based on the unique patterns of blood vessels, particularly in the finger or palm. It is not a behavioral trait.

**c) Performing authentication by extracting the characteristic point called minutia from the pattern formed by ridges**:

- This refers to **fingerprint recognition**, which is a **physical biometric** method that relies on the unique patterns of ridges and valleys in a person's fingerprints. It does not involve behavior.

**d) Performing authentication by extracting the characteristics of chaotic wrinkles in the eye from the pupil to the outside**:

- This describes **iris recognition**, which is a **physical characteristic** based on the unique patterns in a person's iris. It is not a behavioral characteristic.
