Which of the following is a decimal that is represented as a finite digit octal fraction?
a) $0.3$
b) $0.4$
c) $0.5$
d) $0.8$
? 
c) $0.5$

## Testing the waters approach

**NOTE**: This only works for these specific problems, specifically:
- single digit decimal fractions to any base number
Refer to the [[#In-Depth Approach]] for general applications
### Step 1: Multiply all decimal choices by base number
To save time, we can do the initial multiplication of each number by the base number, `8`. This is to hope for a choice that immediately gives a terminating number on the first try.

**Condition:** Achieve a result where the fractional part is `0`
#### a) $0.3\cdot 8 = 2.4$
#### b) $0.4*8 = 3.2$
#### c) $0.5*8 = 4.0$ !!
#### d) $0.8*8 = 6.4$

Therefore, we arrive at our answer, `c)`

## In-Depth Approach
### Step 1: Multiply fractional part by base number
This is according to the general [conversion process of decimal fractions to any base number](https://byjus.com/gate/decimal-to-octal-conversion-notes/#case-02-in-the-case-of-numbers-that-carry-a-fractional-par)
$$\text{formula} = \text{fractional part} \cdot \text{base number}$$

Since we are looking for the `octal fraction`, our `base is 8`, so for letter **a)**
$0.3 \cdot 8 = 2.4$

### Step 2: Separate whole number and fractional number from Step 1
Referring to Step 1:
$2.4 \rightarrow 0.4$ , $2$

Break down uses:
- **whole number** - for getting the final octal fraction
- **fractional number** - for continued multiplication
### Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until fractional number is 0
Ideally, we create a table to keep track of the process.

|             |                  |  Result   | Fractional |  Whole  |
| :---------: | :--------------: | :-------: | :--------: | :-----: |
|   **(1)**   |   $0.3\cdot 8$   |   $2.4$   |   $0.4$    |   $2$   |
| ==**(2)**== | ==$0.4\cdot 8$== | ==$3.2$== | ==$0.2$==  | ==$3$== |
|   **(3)**   |   $0.2\cdot 8$   |   $0.8$   |   $0.8$    |   $0$   |
|   **(4)**   |  $0.8 \cdot 8$   |   $6.4$   |   $0.4$    |   $6$   |
| ==**(5)**== | ==$0.4\cdot 8$== | ==$3.2$== | ==$0.2$==  | ==$3$== |
|     ...     |                  |           |            |         |

**NOTE**: in this case, since we are already looping back, letter **a)** is non-terminating hence, we move on to the next choice.

**IMPORTANT**: to determine a non-terminating fraction, find a step in the conversion table where a step is already similar to a previous step like in this case: `step (2)` and `step (5)`

### Step 4: Repeat process to other choices until finite number
**HOWEVER**, we can take a shortcut:
	if number is part of the previous table/s, it is immediately non-terminating
#### b) 0.4
- part of [[#Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until fractional number is 0|a)]], non-terminating
#### d) 0.8
- part of [[#Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until fractional number is 0|a)]], non-terminating

Therefore, leaving us with
#### c) 0.5
