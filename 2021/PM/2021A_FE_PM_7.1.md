## Explanation

#### Blank A (Drawing the current triangle)

The function `DrawTriangle` is called to calculate and draw the triangular number for `N`, where `N` is the current input. Based on the available options, the correct answer is **N**. This is because the current triangular number corresponds to the input value `N`.

- **Answer for A**: N (option a)

#### Blank B (Drawing the previous triangle)

For `N > 1`, the program draws the previous triangle corresponding to `N - 1`. Hence, the correct option for blank B is **N - 1**.

- **Answer for B**: N - 1 (option c)

#### Blank C (Checking the square property)

The program needs to check whether the sum of the triangular numbers `T(N-1)` and `T(N)` equals `N^2`. The equation to verify this condition is `Ta + Tb == S`, where `S = N * N`. Thus, the correct option is **Ta + Tb == S**.

- **Answer for C**: Ta + Tb == S (option b)

#### Blank D (Printing spaces for alignment)

In the `DrawTriangle` function, the program needs to print spaces to correctly align the dots. The number of spaces should decrease with each row. Therefore, the correct formula for this would be **n - i**.

- **Answer for D**: n - i (option d)

#### Blank E (Loop for printing 'o's in the triangle)

The loop should run as many times as the row number `i`, meaning that the correct condition is **j <= i**.

- **Answer for E**: j <= i (option c)
