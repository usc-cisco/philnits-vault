?
A,C

## Explanation

### For **E**:

- The context mentions **encrypting the message first and then signing it later**.
- When you **encrypt a message first**, the signature is applied to the original content after encryption. This allows anyone to immediately verify whether the message is authentic by checking the signature without having to decrypt it.
  By encrypting first, the recipient can **quickly verify the authenticity of the message** because the signature (which could contain information about the sender) is applied after encryption and is therefore not hidden. This fits with option **(a) "detect and discard unauthenticated message earlier"**, as encrypting first enables the recipient to discard unauthenticated messages as soon as they receive them.

### For **F**:

- The context refers to **signing the original message first**, which means applying the signature before encrypting the message.
- When a message is **signed first**, the content of the message is hidden, including any information about the sender. After the message is encrypted, only the recipient with the private key can decrypt it. Once decrypted, the recipient can verify the signature to know who signed it.
  The main advantage of this is that the **identity of the signer is hidden**; only the intended recipient will know who signed the message. This aligns with option **(c) "hide the signatory of the private key from unintended parties"**. The encryption ensures that no unintended party can see the signature or the signer's identity.
