## Explanation

## For F

The missing code in the loop logic needs to correctly iterate through the square and print the required characters.

The correct answer for **F** (the missing condition for the inner loop) is:

**Answer for F:**  
(b) i + 1

Explanation:

- The inner loop runs `n - i` times to print spaces, ensuring the structure aligns properly when printing the characters. As `i` increases, fewer spaces are printed on each new row.

## For **G**

The pattern represents a **square of size 3**, with a triangle of 'o's and the other side filled with '\*'s.  
Hereâ€™s what the complete square looks like for **n = 3**:`

Thus, the correct answer is:  
**(c)**

## For H

This part involves **square and triangular numbers**.

- T(2)=3T(2) = 3T(2)=3 (triangular number for 2)
- T(3)=6T(3) = 6T(3)=6 (triangular number for 3)
- The **square number** for 3 is S(3)=9S(3) = 9S(3)=9.

From the provided math logic:

- T(3)+T(2)=S(3)T(3) + T(2) = S(3)T(3)+T(2)=S(3), which is **9**.

Thus, the correct answer is:  
**(c) T(2) + T(3) = S(3)**
