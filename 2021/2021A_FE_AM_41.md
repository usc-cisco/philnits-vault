Between a client and web server, which of the following is used for inspecting the data that is sent from the client to the web server and blocking attacks, such as SQL injections?

a) Cluster configuration
b) Load balancing function 
c) SSL-VPN function 
d) WAF
? 
d) WAF
### Explanation

A **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** is a security tool specifically designed to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a client and a web server. It inspects the data sent from the client to the server and can detect and block common attacks such as **SQL injections**, **cross-site scripting (XSS)**, and other web-based threats. A WAF adds an extra layer of defense, helping to prevent malicious traffic from reaching the web server.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) Cluster configuration**:

- A **cluster configuration** refers to a group of servers working together to improve performance, availability, or redundancy. It is not related to inspecting or blocking attacks like SQL injections.

**b) Load balancing function**:

- **Load balancing** distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. While it improves performance and availability, it does not inspect or block web-based attacks.

**c) SSL-VPN function**:

- **SSL-VPN (Secure Sockets Layer Virtual Private Network)** is used to securely connect remote users to a network via encryption. It ensures secure communication but is not designed to inspect or block web application attacks like SQL injection.
