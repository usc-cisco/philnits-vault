The in-order traversal of a binary tree is a procedure that visits all nodes of the tree. For a non-empty binary tree `T`, it performs the following operations in order.
1) Recursively performs the in-order traversal of the left subtree of `T`.
2) Visits the root node of `T`.
3) Recursively performs the in-order traversal of the right subtree of `T`.

Which of the following is the ordered sequence of nodes when the in-order traversal is performed on the binary tree below?![[Pasted image 20241018165551.png]]
a) $1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 5, 3, 6, 9$ 
b) $6, 9, 3, 1, 5, 2, 8, 4, 7$
c) $7, 4, 8, 2, 5, 1, 3, 9, 6$ 
d) $7, 8, 4, 5, 2, 9, 6, 3, 1$
? 
c) $7, 4, 8, 2, 5, 1, 3, 9, 6$ 
### Step 1: Start at left-most subtree: `Node 7`
We go to leaf node 7:
- it is a valid subtree (1 node)
- we cannot go deeper as it has no children
![[Pasted image 20241018170137.png]]
**Sequence:** $7$

### Step 2: Go to parent of `Node 7`: `Node 4`
According to 2nd instruction:
- go to parent of node T (7) which is node 4
![[Pasted image 20241018170510.png]]
**Sequence:** $7,4$
### WE CAN ALREADY STOP HERE AND ANS. `C)`

## Process Continuation
### Step 3: Repeat in-order process to right-subtree of `Node 4`: `Node 8`
We go to leaf node 8:
- it is a valid subtree (1 node)
- we cannot go deeper as it has no **children**
![[Pasted image 20241018170936.png]]
**Sequence:** $7,4,8$

### Step 4: Go back to `Node 4`
**NOTE:** already visited, do not write in sequence, continue
### Step 5: Go to parent of `Node 4`: `Node 2`
According to 2nd instruction:
- go to parent of node T (4) which is node 2
![[Pasted image 20241018171307.png]]
**Sequence:** $7,4,8,2$
### Step 6: Repeat in-order process to right-subtree of `Node 2`: `Node 5`
We go to leaf node 5:
- it is a valid subtree (1 node)
- we cannot go deeper as it has no **children**
![[Pasted image 20241018171815.png]]
**Sequence:** $7,4,8,2,5$

### Step 7: Go to parent of parent of `Node 5`: `Node 1`
![[Pasted image 20241018172540.png]]
**Sequence:** $7,4,8,2,5,1$

### Step 8: Repeat in-order process to right-subtree of `Node 1`: `Node 3`
Cannot go to left-most subtree (no left subtree)
Hence, it becomes the left-most subtree
![[Pasted image 20241018172602.png]]
**Sequence:** $7,4,8,2,5,1,3$

### Step 9: Repeat in-order process to right-subtree of `Node 3`: `Node 6`
**Sequence:** $7,4,8,2,5,1,3$

### Step 10: Go to left-most subtree of `Node 6`: `Node 9`
Leaf-node, place itself
![[Pasted image 20241018172634.png]]
**Sequence:** $7,4,8,2,5,1,3,9$

### Step 11: Go to parent of `Node 9`: `Node 6`
![[Pasted image 20241018172652.png]]
**Sequence:** $7,4,8,2,5,1,3,9,6$
**NO MORE ELEMENTS OR SUBTREES --END--**

### Hence, the answer is c)
