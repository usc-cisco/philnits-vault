In the system design stage, which of the following is the point to be checked during the audit of control for reducing the risk of non-fulfillment of user requirements?

a) All programming should be performed in accordance with the specified standards and conventions.
b) The program specifications should be created on the basis of the system design documents.
c) The test plan should be created on the basis of the system test requirements and must also be approved by the responsible person of the system operations department.
d) The user department should participate in the review of system design.
?
d) The user department should participate in the review of system design.
### Explanation

Involving the user department in the review of system design is critical to ensuring that the system meets the actual needs and requirements of the users. This reduces the risk of non-fulfillment of user requirements, as it ensures that users validate the system design and provide feedback before implementation begins.
### Why the Others Won't Fit

**a) All programming should be performed in accordance with the specified standards and conventions.**

- This relates more to code quality and consistency but is not directly about reducing the risk of not meeting user requirements. It would be checked during the development phase, not specifically in the system design stage.

**b) The program specifications should be created on the basis of the system design documents.**

- While this is an important practice, it pertains to the transition from design to development and doesn't directly address reducing the risk of unmet user requirements during the design stage.

**c) The test plan should be created on the basis of the system test requirements and must also be approved by the responsible person of the system operations department.**

- This is more relevant to the testing phase and ensuring proper validation, but it does not directly focus on reducing the risk of non-fulfillment of user requirements during the design phase.
