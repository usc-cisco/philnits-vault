For an 8-bit binary integer, which of the following is the operation that extracts the most significant 4-bits while making the other bits zero?

a) Bitwise AND operation with 11110000.
b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.
c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.
d) Bitwise XOR operation with 00001111.
?
a) Bitwise AND operation with 11110000.

For any 8-bit binary integer that is AND-ed with 11110000, the result will always be whatever were the first four digits of the integer and 0000, effectively extracting the first four bits.

**b) Bitwise NAND operation with 11110000.**

This will only reverse the value of the first four bits and turn the last four bits into 1's.

**c) Bitwise OR operation with 00001111.**

This will turn the last four bits into 1's.

**d) Bitwise XOR operation with 00001111.**

Any bit among the last four bits that happens to be 1 will become 0.
