Which of the following is a technology used to provide dynamic UI contents without reloading the entire web page by using an asynchronous communication feature of JavaScript?

**a) Ajax**

**b) CSS**

**c) RSS**

**d) SNS**
?
**a) Ajax**
## **Explanation:**
**Ajax** is a set of web development techniques that allow for asynchronous communication between the client and server. It enables web pages to update dynamically by retrieving data from the server without needing to reload the entire page. Therefore, the answer is **a**.

**b)** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It does not provide any dynamic content loading capabilities or asynchronous communication.

**c)** Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a web feed format used for delivering regularly changing web content, such as news articles or blog posts. It is not related to dynamic content updates on a web page without reloading.

**d)** Social Networking Service (SNS) refers to platforms and services that enable users to create and share content or participate in social networking. While they may use technologies like Ajax for dynamic content, SNS itself is not a technology for asynchronous communication.
