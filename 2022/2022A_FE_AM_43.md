Which of the following is the purpose of using a message authentication code? 

**a) To check the encryption method of a message** 

**b) To check the overview of a message** 

**c) To confirm that there is no falsification of a message** 

**d) To secure the confidentiality of a message**
? 
**c) To confirm that there is no falsification of a message** 

## **Explanation:**

A **message authentication code** is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message and confirm its integrity and authenticity. When a sender generates a MAC for a message, it involves applying a cryptographic algorithm and a secret key. The MAC ensures that:

- The message has not been altered in transit (integrity).
- The message is from a legitimate sender who possesses the secret key (authentication).

If the recipient calculates the MAC on the received message and it matches the MAC sent by the sender, it confirms that the message has not been tampered with and is indeed from the expected sender.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** A MAC does not check the encryption method; it focuses on message integrity and authenticity.
- **b)** The term "overview of a message" is vague and not relevant to the function of a MAC.
- **d)** While a MAC can help protect the integrity of a message, it does not provide confidentiality. Confidentiality is typically ensured through encryption.

In summary, the correct answer is **c) To confirm that there is no falsification of a message**.
