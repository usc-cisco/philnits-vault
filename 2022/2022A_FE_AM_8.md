# 2022A_FE_AM_8 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

When a two-dimensional array A(5,5) is mapped to computer memory (i.e. a one-dimensional array) in row-major (row-directional) order or column-major (column-directional) order, how many elements occupy the same memory addresses in both cases? Here, the first element A(1,1) is mapped to the same starting memory address in either case.

**a) 2**

**b) 3**

**c) 4**

**d) 5**
? 
**d) 5**
## **Explanation:**
In a 5x5 array, the same address means that the row and column of the array index are of equal value. To visualize:

 There are 5 same addresses in the 5x5 array. So the answer is **d**.
