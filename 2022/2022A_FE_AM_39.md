Which of the following is the protocol that is used together with HTTP in HTTPS?

**a) SHA**

**b) SSH** 

**c) TLS** 

**d) VPN**
? 
**c) TLS** 

## **Explanation:**

**TLS** is the protocol that encrypts HTTP traffic to create HTTPS (HTTP Secure). It ensures the security of data transmitted over the internet by providing encryption, authentication, and integrity checks. **TLS** is a successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and is widely used in secure communications. Therefore, the answer is **c)**.

**a)** **Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)** is a family of cryptographic hash functions used to ensure data integrity. While it plays a role in secure communications, it is not a protocol and does not directly function as the underlying protocol for HTTPS.

**b)** **Secure Shell (SSH)** is a protocol used for secure remote login and other secure network services over an unsecured network. Although it provides secure communication, it is not used in conjunction with HTTP to create HTTPS.

**d)** A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** creates a secure connection over a less secure network, such as the internet, but it is not specifically a protocol like TLS. VPNs are used to protect internet traffic from snooping and interference, but they are not directly involved in the encryption of HTTP to form HTTPS.
