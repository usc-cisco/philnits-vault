An attacker calls a corporate help desk, masquerading as an employee who has forgotten his password. The help desk staff resets the password to the company default “password1. ” The attacker then uses this password to access the company network and information on the server. What is this type of attack called?

**a) Buffer overflow attack** 

**b) Denial-of-Service attack**

**c) Shoulder surfing** 

**d) Social engineering**
? 
**d) Social engineering** 

## **Explanation:**

**Social engineering** involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes. In this case:

- The attacker pretends to be an employee who has forgotten their password.
- The help desk staff, without verifying the caller's identity properly, resets the password to a default value.
- The attacker then uses the reset password to gain unauthorized access to the company network.

This attack relies on the human element of security rather than exploiting technical vulnerabilities, making it a classic example of social engineering. Therefore, the answer is **d)**.

**a) Buffer overflow attack:** This is a technical exploit where an attacker sends more data to a buffer than it can handle, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**b) Denial-of-Service attack:** This attack aims to make a service unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with traffic or requests.

**c) Shoulder surfing:** This involves an attacker observing someone as they enter sensitive information, such as a password, typically in a physical setting.
