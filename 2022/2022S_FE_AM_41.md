Which of the following is an appropriate description of footprinting in computer security?
a) Digital forensic analysis to find the hacker after a hacking incident
b) Gathering information about an organization and its systems in preparation for an attack
c) Listing all affected files in the system in order to assess the impact of an attack
d) Setting up an intrusion detection system in order to detect when an attacker breaks into the internal network 
? 
b) Gathering information about an organization and its systems in preparation for an attack

## What is Footprinting?

Footprinting in computer security refers to the process of gathering information about a target organization and its systems. This is typically done in the early stages of a cyberattack to identify potential vulnerabilities. The goal of footprinting is to create a blueprint of the target's infrastructure, such as its network layout, security configurations, IP addresses, and other details that can help an attacker plan a more focused and effective attack.

-  A): Digital forensic analysis refers to the process of investigating a system **after** a cyber incident has occurred, which is not the same as footprinting.
-  **B): Correct—this describes footprinting, as it involves gathering information before launching an attack, helping hackers understand the target better.**
-  C): Listing affected files post-attack falls under incident response or forensics, not footprinting.
-  D): Setting up an intrusion detection system is part of defense mechanisms and doesn’t describe footprinting.
