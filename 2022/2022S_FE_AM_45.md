Which of the following is a system or network that is intentionally made vulnerable in
order to investigate the behavior of an intruder or malware?
a) Botnet
b) DMZ
c) Honey pot
d) SIEM
? 
c) Honey pot
## **Explanation:**

In cybersecurity, certain strategies are employed to detect, analyze, and understand intrusions or malware attacks. One such strategy involves creating environments that appear vulnerable to attackers. These environments, often referred to as **honeypots**, are designed to lure intruders, allowing security professionals to study their tactics, techniques, and behaviors without risking actual systems.

 - A): Botnet: A botnet is a network of infected devices controlled by a hacker, often used to perform malicious activities like DDoS attacks. It is not intentionally made vulnerable for investigation purposes.
- B): DMZ: A DMZ (demilitarized zone) is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization’s external-facing services to an untrusted network, typically the Internet. It is not specifically designed for observing intruders.
- **C): Honey pot: Correct—A honeypot is a deliberately vulnerable system designed to attract attackers and gather intelligence on their methods, helping organizations strengthen their defenses.**
- D): SIEM: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems aggregate and analyze security data from across an organization’s network but are not intentionally vulnerable systems.
