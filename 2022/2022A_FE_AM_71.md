Which of the following is an explanation of the Kanban (just-in-time) system? 

**a) To improve work efficiency at each operation, parts and semi-finished products having unified specifications are procured.** 

**b) To minimize intermediate stock, parts required for the production line are procured from the previous process on the basis of a production plan.** 

**c) To procure parts efficiently, they are procured from affiliated companies.** 

**d) To procure parts of higher quality, parts are procured via competitive bidding among designated suppliers.**
? 
**b) To minimize intermediate stock, parts required for the production line are procured from the previous process on the basis of a production plan.** 

## **Explanation:**

The **Kanban (just-in-time) system** is designed to improve production efficiency by **minimizing inventory** and ensuring that parts are produced or delivered **only when needed**. It relies on signals (often called Kanban cards) to indicate when materials should be supplied, reducing waste and intermediate stock.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a) To improve work efficiency at each operation, parts and semi-finished products having unified specifications are procured** describes a standardization approach, not specific to the Kanban system.
- **c) To procure parts efficiently, they are procured from affiliated companies** refers to **procurement strategies**, but it doesn't define the Kanban system.
- **d) To procure parts of higher quality, parts are procured via competitive bidding among designated suppliers** refers to a **competitive bidding process**, not to Kanban.

Therefore, the correct answer is **b) To minimize intermediate stock, parts required for the production line are procured from the previous process on the basis of a production plan.**
