## **Explanation:**

#### **System Audits and IT Internal Controls:**

System audits or security audits in **cybersecurity** are comprehensive examinations of an organization's IT systems and internal controls, aiming to ensure data security and compliance with industry standards. These audits assess the protection of data, networks, and IT processes against risks and threats, while also verifying compliance with internal policies and external regulations.

Cybersecurity audits are vital for identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring that proper controls are in place to mitigate risks, helping businesses maintain operational security and data integrity.

#### **Key Areas Audited in IT Systems:**

System audits typically cover several critical areas, such as:

1. **Data Input Accuracy**: Ensuring that data entered into IT systems is correct and reliable.
2. **Access Controls**: Verifying that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data and systems, ensuring robust **user authentication** and **authorization** processes.
3. **Process Integrity**: Confirming that IT processes support business operations without introducing security risks or inefficiencies.

#### **Audit Focus Areas:**

- **a) Methods for ensuring accuracy when the sales department inputs into and updates the database.**  
    Correct! This focuses on **data input accuracy**, a crucial part of internal controls. In cybersecurity audits, verifying that sales data is accurately entered is important for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors or fraud.

- **b) The process by which the business planning department leads the creation of a mid-term business plan.**  
    This is a business-related process, unrelated to IT systems or cybersecurity controls, and thus not typically part of a cybersecurity audit.

- **c) The results of employee personnel evaluations led by the personnel department.**  
    Personnel evaluations fall under human resources and do not involve IT internal controls or cybersecurity.

- **d) The status of production equipment review conducted by the manufacturing department for the purpose of reducing defects.**  
    This focuses on operational efficiency rather than IT systems or cybersecurity, so it wouldn’t be covered in a system audit.

The correct focus of a **cybersecurity system audit** would be on ensuring data input accuracy and process integrity, making **a) Methods for ensuring accuracy when the sales department inputs into and updates the database** the correct answer. Cybersecurity audits, whether conducted internally or externally, focus on identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with security standards.
