Which of the following is a description of SOA?

**a) It consists of four (4) main concepts; the business scheme, data scheme, application and processing scheme, and technical scheme, and it aims to optimize the business and the system.**

**b) It makes it easier to address a change in the business by constructing software from components called services.**

**c) It performs design at the component levels by using a combination of three (3) logical structures; a sequence, selection, and iteration.**

**d) It uses a data flow diagram and simultaneously creates a model regarding information and a model regarding functions.**
?
**b) It makes it easier to address a change in the business by constructing software from components called services.**

## **Explanation:**

**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** is an architectural pattern that allows software applications to communicate with each other over a network by using services. These services are reusable components that can be combined and orchestrated to support business processes. By adopting **SOA**, organizations can respond more flexibly to changes in business requirements, as services can be modified or replaced independently without significant impacts on the overall system.

### Brief Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** While SOA may have concepts that relate to optimizing business and systems, this description is more aligned with broader architectural frameworks and not specific to SOA.
- **c)** This description pertains more to structured programming concepts rather than the service-oriented approach of SOA.
- **d)** This description relates to traditional system modeling techniques rather than the principles of SOA.

In summary, the correct answer is **b) It makes it easier to address a change in the business by constructing software from components called services.**
