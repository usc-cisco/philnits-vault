For a given decimal data, the check digit is calculated with the method below and is appended to the original data. When the given data is 7394, what is the result? Here, the weight is 1234 and the base number is 11. 
- (1) For each digit of the data, calculate the product with the digit at the same radix of the weight and calculate the sum of these products. 
- (2) Calculate the remainder after the division of the sum by the base number. 
- (3) Subtract the remainder from the base number and let the last digit of the result be the check digit.


**a) 73940**

**b) 73941**

**c) 73944**

**d) 73947**
? 
**a) 73940**

## **Explanation:**

To find the check digit for the given decimal data 7394 using the specified method, we will follow the steps outlined:
#### **Given:**
- Data: **7394**
- Weight: **1234**
- Base Number: **11**

### **1. Calculate the sum of products**
For each digit of the data, we calculate the product with the corresponding weight:
#### $7~\cdot~1 = 7$
#### $3~\cdot~2 = 6$
#### $9~\cdot~3 = 27$
#### $4~\cdot~4 = 16$

Sum the products
#### $7+6+27+16=56$
### **2. Calculate the remainder**
Now we calculate the remainder when the sum is divided by the base number (11):
#### $56~\text{mod}~11 =1$
### **3. Calculate the check digit**
Next, we subtract the remainder from the base number and take the last digit of the result:
#### $11-1=10$

The last digit of 10 is 0, which means the check digit is 0.

### **Conclusion:**
Appending the check digit to the original data gives:
#### $7394~\text{becomes}~73940$

Therefore, the answer is **a**).
