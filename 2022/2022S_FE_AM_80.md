## **Explanation:**

#### **Cash Flow:**

**Cash flow** refers to the movement of money in and out of a company over a specific time period. For a business to remain financially healthy, it needs to manage its cash flow effectively, ensuring that more money is coming in than going out, which means **positive cash flow**. Poor cash flow management can lead to financial challenges, even if a company is profitable. One important aspect of cash flow management is **timing**—when cash comes in and when it goes out. The timing of payments and receipts can be adjusted to improve the company’s cash flow position. 
## **Checking:**

- **a) Pay the notes payable on a shorter timeline.**

    This option would **reduce** the company's cash reserves sooner, as paying notes payable (which are debts) faster means cash is going out at a quicker rate. This action would **not improve cash flow** because it speeds up the outflow of cash.

- **b) Receive payment on the notes receivable on a longer timeline.**

    This would **delay cash inflows**, as you would be giving customers or clients more time to pay what they owe. Extending the payment timeline for receivables will **worsen cash flow**, as it delays incoming cash.

- **c) Shorten the time period for collecting accounts receivable.**

    This option refers to **speeding up the collection of money** owed to the company. By receiving payments faster, cash comes into the business more quickly, improving the company’s liquidity. This is a positive action that **improves cash flow**.

- **d) Shorten the time period for making payments on accounts payable.**

    Similar to option (a), this would mean **paying bills faster**. While paying bills on time is necessary, shortening the payment period reduces cash on hand earlier than necessary. This action would **reduce cash flow** because it accelerates cash outflows.

 The correct action to **improve cash flow** is **c) Shorten the time period for collecting accounts receivable**. By collecting payments more quickly, a company increases its cash inflows, improving its overall cash position and ability to meet short-term obligations. This aligns with effective cash flow management practices, where timely collections help maintain a positive cash flow .
