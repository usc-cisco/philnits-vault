### **Explanation:**

The question asks to calculate the **expected profit** for each of the four products (**A, B, C, D**) based on the sales forecasts (High, Medium, Low) and their probabilities. The expected profit is calculated using the **expected value principle**, which helps businesses determine which product is likely to be the most profitable, considering different possible outcomes.

**Expected value** is the sum of all possible profits multiplied by their respective probabilities. It gives an idea of the average profit a company can expect in the long run, considering different sales scenarios.

#### **Steps to Solve the Problem Using Expected Value:**

The formula for expected value (expected profit) remains the same: 

Expected Profit = (High Profit × High Probability) + (Medium Profit × Medium Probability) + (Low Profit × Low Probability)

#### **Step 1: Calculate Expected Profit for Product A**

- High: 100,000 × 0.75 = 75,000
- Medium: 20,000 × 0.20 = 4,000
- Low: (−40,000) × 0.05 = −2,000

**Total Expected Profit for A**: 75,000 + 4,000 − 2,000 = 77,000

#### **Step 2: Calculate Expected Profit for Product B**

- High: 130,000 × 0.60 = 78,000
- Medium: 30,000 × 0.30 = 9,000
- Low: (−20,000) × 0.10 = −2,000

**Total Expected Profit for B**: 78,000 + 9,000 − 2,000 = 85,000

#### **Step 3: Calculate Expected Profit for Product C**

- High: 150,000 × 0.50 = 75,000
- Medium: 40,000 × 0.30 = 12,000
- Low: (−20,000) × 0.20 = −4,000

**Total Expected Profit for C**: 75,000 + 12,000 − 4,000 = 83,000

#### **Step 4: Calculate Expected Profit for Product D**

- High: 100,000 × 0.75 = 75,000
- Medium: 20,000 × 0.20 = 4,000
- Low: (−40,000) × 0.05 = −2,000

**Total Expected Profit for D**: 70,000 + 2,000 − 5,000 = 67,000

#### **Step 5: Find the Product with the Highest Expected Profit**

**Product B** has the highest **expected profit** of **85,000**.
