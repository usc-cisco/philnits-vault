## **Explanation:**

#### **Core Competence in Business Administration:**

Core competence refers to the unique capabilities or advantages that a company possesses, which distinguish it from its competitors. These competencies are vital for a business's long-term success, as they are often difficult for competitors to replicate or imitate. Core competencies typically provide superior value to customers and align with the strategic goals of a company.

Examples of core competencies include Apple’s focus on innovation, Jollibee's strong brand / cultural relevance, or San Miguel Corp's diversification and operational scale.

- **a) Corporate activities that comply with laws, various regulations, and social norms for managing business.**  
    This describes **corporate governance** and regulatory compliance rather than core competence. Following regulations is important but doesn't inherently give a company a unique competitive edge.

- **b) The business domain decided from the viewpoint of the market, technology, and products (or services).**  
    This refers to **business strategy** or market positioning, where a company decides what sectors or products to focus on. It is about defining the company's direction rather than identifying the unique competencies that set it apart from competitors.

- **c) The overall business and system optimization methods for achieving the purpose of organizational activities.**  
    This answer describes **organizational efficiency** and optimization, which are important for smooth operations but are not directly related to core competence. It focuses on internal processes rather than the distinctive capabilities that give a company a market advantage.

- **d) The predominant abilities in the company’s business area, which competitors cannot imitate.**  
    **Correct!** This is the definition of core competence. It highlights the unique skills, resources, or technologies that differentiate the company from others and provide long-term competitive advantages.

The correct answer is **d) The predominant abilities in the company’s business area, which competitors cannot imitate**. Core competence plays a crucial role in shaping a company's competitive edge, helping it maintain market leadership by leveraging its unique strengths that others cannot easily copy.
