b) A continuous, bell-shaped distribution that is symmetric about its mean

### What is normal distribution?
- Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a [probability distribution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probabilitydistribution.asp) that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. The normal distribution appears as a "[bell curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bell-curve.asp)" when graphed.

### Analyzing each option:
a) “A continuous, bathtub-shaped distribution that is used to express the failure rate”
- **Bathtub-Shaped Distribution:** This typically refers to reliability engineering models where the failure rate changes over time, often decreasing initially, then constant, and increasing later—resembling a bathtub's cross-section.
- **Normal Distribution:** Does **not** have a bathtub shape. Instead, it is bell-shaped and symmetric.

b) “A continuous, bell-shaped distribution that is symmetric about its mean”
- **Continuous:** Yes.
- **Bell-Shaped:** Yes.
- **Symmetric About Mean:** Yes.

c) “A discrete distribution that expresses the probability of an event occurring a given number of   times in a fixed interval”
- **Discrete Distribution:** The normal distribution is **continuous**, not discrete.
- **Description Fits:** This description aligns more with the **Poisson** or **Binomial** distributions.

d) “A discrete distribution where all events have the same probability to occur”
- **Discrete Distribution:** The normal distribution is **continuous**, not discrete.
- **Uniform Probability:** This describes the **Uniform** discrete distribution.
