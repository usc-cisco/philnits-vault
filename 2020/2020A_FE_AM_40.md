Which of the following is a characteristic of a worm, as compared with a Trojan horse?

a) Arbitrarily encrypting files so that they cannot be read normally 
b) Causing an infection to spread by itself by using the network and removable media 
c) Performing an unauthorized action as an individual program 
d) Waiting without performing any activity until a specific condition is established
? 
b) Causing an infection to spread by itself by using the network and removable media 

## **Explanation:**

b) A **worm** is a type of malware that can **spread by itself** across networks and through removable media (like USB drives). Unlike a Trojan horse, which requires the user to execute the program, worms exploit vulnerabilities and propagate automatically without user intervention.
### Other Options

a.) is incorrect because arbitrarily encrypting files is a characteristic of **ransomware**, not a worm.

c) is incorrect because performing an unauthorized action as an individual program is characteristic of a **Trojan horse**, which masquerades as legitimate software but performs malicious actions when executed.

d) is incorrect because waiting for a specific condition before acting is characteristic of a **logic bomb**, not a worm.
