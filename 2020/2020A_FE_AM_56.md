?
d) Receiving a failure report from a user and checking to see if it corresponds to a known error
## **Explanation:**

In **IT service management**, **incident management** focuses on restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible after a disruption. One of the key activities is receiving failure reports (incidents) from users and determining if they correspond to a **known error** that already has a documented workaround or solution. This is a crucial part of the incident management process to minimize the impact on service.
### Other Options

**a) Evaluating customer satisfaction and performing reviews** – This is part of **service level management**, which focuses on ensuring service performance aligns with agreed targets, not incident management.

**b) Examining free disk space** – This is part of **capacity management** or **monitoring**, not incident and service request management.

**c) Investigating the impact of changes** – This falls under **change management**, which deals with assessing the impact of changes to the IT environment, not incidents or service requests.
