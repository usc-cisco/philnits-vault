A factory manufactures the same products on two production lines, A and B. Line A manufactures $60$% of all products, and B manufactures the remaining $40$%. Defect rates of products manufactured in A and in B are $2$% and $1$%, respectively. When a product was randomly chosen for inspection among the products manufactured in this factory, it was found to be defective. What is the percentage of probability that the product was manufactured in Line A?
a) 40
b) 50
c) 60
d) 75
? 
d) 75
### Step 1: Calculate the total defective products for each line.

Line A: $60$% $\times$ $2$% $=$ $1.2$% of total products
- Line A has a total of $1.2$% of defective products.
Line B: $40$% $\times$ $1$% $=$ $0.4$% of total products
- Line B has a total of $0.4$% of defective products.

### Step 2: Combine both to calculate the total percentage of defective products.

Total defects $=$ $1.2$% $+$ $0.4$% $=$ $1.6$% of total products
- $1.6$% of all products are defective.

### Step 3: Find the proportion of defective products from Line A.

$\frac{Defects from A}{Total defects} = \frac{1.2}{1.6} = 0.75$
- Therefore, there's a $75$% chance of probability that the product was manufactured in A.
