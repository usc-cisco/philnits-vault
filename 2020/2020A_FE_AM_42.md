There is a network that is divided into three (3) segments (i.e., external segment, DMZ, and internal segment) by one (1) firewall. In this network, a service for users is to be made available over the Internet by using a system comprising a web server and a database server containing important data. Which of the following is the most appropriate method of server installation that can protect important data from unauthorized access from the Internet? Here, only a specific protocol is allowed for communications between the external segment and the DMZ, and between the DMZ and the internal segment by the firewall. Direct communication between the external segment and the internal segment is not allowed.

a) Installation of the web server and database server in the internal segment 
b) Installation of the web server and the database server in the DMZ 
c) Installation of the web server in the DMZ and the database server in the internal segment 
d) Installation of the web server in the external segment and the database server in the DMZ
? 
c) Installation of the web server in the DMZ and the database server in the internal segment 

## **Explanation:**

The scenario requires balancing user accessibility with the protection of sensitive data stored in the server. The **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** is a semi-trusted network that is accessible from the **external network**, and the **internal segment** is the most secure part of the network, designed to protect sensitive data from external threats. The **external network** is available to anyone, making it less secure and more likely to face attacks.

The **web server** is intended for users to access services, so placing it in the **DMZ** would allow it to be reachable from the external network while maintaining a level of security. The DMZ allows the web server to interact with users and restricts direct access to the internal network.

Meanwhile, the **database**, which contains important and sensitive data, should be placed in the **internal segment**, the most secure part of the network. This placement ensures that the database is well-protected from unauthorized access, and only the web server in the DMZ (or other authorized systems) can communicate with it.
