b) The version information of the DNS server software is obtained to identify a security hole.*

**a) False domain information is injected into the DNS server that is referenced by a PC, and it leads the user to a fake server.**
## **Explanation:**

**DNS cache poisoning** occurs when a hacker tricks a DNS resolver into storing incorrect information in its cache. This incorrect information would redirect the users or hosts into the malicious sites instead of the legitimate ones they intended to visit. The attacker can use this to steal sensitive information, spread malware, or conduct phishing attacks.
