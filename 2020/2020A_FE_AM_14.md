In a web system, which of the following is an appropriate benefit of a web server and an application (AP) server being placed on different physical servers?
a) Because the business logic that accompanies an access to data is placed in a program on the web server, the program on the AP server does not need to be changed in association with a change in the business logic.
b) Because the difference between the character coding scheme of the web browser and that of the AP server is absorbed by the web server, garbled (or unreadable) characters do not appear.
c) Because the execution environment of the client is implemented on the web server, the client and the AP server do not need to exchange screen data for each request, and only a small amount of data communication is required.
d) Processing can be distributed according to the type of request from a client in such a way that a request for static content having a light load is processed by the web server, and a request for dynamic content having a heavy load is processed by the AP server.

d) Processing can be distributed according to the type of request from a client in such a way that a request for static content having a light load is processed by the web server, and a request for dynamic content having a heavy load is processed by the AP server.
### Explanation:

a) **Incorrect**
- Business logic is usually handled by the **application server**, not the web server. Changing business logic would require updates on the AP server, not the web server.
b) **Incorrect**
- Encoding issues are usually addressed in the software, not in server separation.
c) **Incorrect**
- The **web server** doesn't run the execution environment of the client (typically a browser). The separation of the web and application servers doesn't reduce client-server communication, as data still needs to be exchanged.
d) **Correct**
- Separating the web server and AP server allows for load balancing:
	- **Static content** (HTML, CSS, images) is handled by the **web server**.
	- **Dynamic content** (database queries or business logic) is processed by the application server.

Option 'd' highlights the primary benefit of separating web and application servers, which is the ability to optimize and distribute processing load efficiently between static and dynamic content.
