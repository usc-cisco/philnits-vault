# 2020A_FE_AM_36 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

Which of the following is a type of public-key cryptography that utilizes the difficulty of factorizing extremely large numbers into primes?

a) AES 
b) DH 
c) DSA
d) RSA.
? 
d) RSA.
## **Explanation:**

**d) RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** -  a **public-key encryption algorithm** that relies specifically on the difficulty of breaking down a large number into the two prime numbers that were used to create it.
### Other Options

**a) AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** - is a **symmetric encryption algorithm**, which means it uses the same key for both locking and unlocking the data (encrypting and decrypting). It relies on complex mathematical operations like substitution and permutation to securely encrypt data.

**b) DH (Diffie-Hellman)** - is a method used for **securely exchanging cryptographic keys** over a public channel, so two people can share a secret key without someone else figuring it out. It uses math based on something called **discrete logarithms.**

**c) DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)** - is a **digital signature algorithm**, which is used for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. It also relies on the **discrete logarithm problem** for its security.
