b) $O(n\log(n)), O(n^2)$

In a randomized version of the quicksort algorithm, the average-case and worst-case time complexities are as follows:

- **Average-Case Time Complexity:** $O(nlogn)$
  This occurs because, on average, the pivot divides the array into two approximately equal halves.
- **Worst-Case Time Complexity:** $O(n2)$  
   This happens when the pivot is consistently the smallest or largest element, leading to unbalanced partitions (though this is rare with random pivot selection).

So the answer is:
b) $O(n\log(n)), O(n^2)$
