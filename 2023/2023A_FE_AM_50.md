a) Concurrent engineering
b) Forward engineering 
c) Reverse engineering
d) Social engineering 
? 
c) Reverse engineering

### **Reverse Engineering**:

- **Definition**: Reverse engineering involves taking an existing system (hardware or software) and analyzing it to understand its components and operations, often to extract design specifications or to recreate the system.
- **Process**: You start with a **functioning system** and work backwards to uncover its **lower-level specifications** (such as design, source code, or architecture).
- **Example**: Taking apart a piece of software to understand how it works or extracting the source code from compiled code.

### **Forward Engineering**:

- **Definition**: Forward engineering is the process of **developing a system from specifications** or design documents to a fully functioning system.
- **Process**: You start with **specifications or design documents** and move forward to create a **functioning system**.
- **Example**: Using detailed specifications to build a new software application or hardware system.

### **Other Terms**:

### a) **Concurrent Engineering**:

- **Definition**: Concurrent engineering refers to an approach where **multiple phases of product development (such as design, manufacturing, and testing)** are performed simultaneously rather than sequentially.
- **Goal**: To improve the efficiency of product development by overlapping processes and encouraging collaboration across departments from the very beginning.
- **Example**: Engineers, designers, and testers working together from the outset of a project to speed up the time to market.

### d) **Social Engineering**:

- **Definition**: Social engineering is a method of **manipulating people** to divulge confidential information or perform actions that may compromise security, typically through psychological manipulation.
- **Example**: A hacker calls an employee pretending to be from IT and convinces them to reveal their password.
