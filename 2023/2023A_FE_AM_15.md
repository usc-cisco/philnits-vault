Which of the following is the most appropriate explanation of grid computing?

a) A computing task is distributed to several computers in the network to attain 
computational capacity. 
b) Physical devices such as computers or network devices are emulated to circumvent 
compatibility constraints and attain software portability and flexibility. 
c) Requirements are stated as constraints on response time and/or on the temporal validity 
of sensory data. 
d) Sensing devices are connected to a network to provide feedback and control through 
personal mobile devices.
? 
a) A computing task is distributed to several computers in the network to attain 
computational capacity. 

## Intuition

When you think of a grid, you think of multiple nodes that connect to one another to create a network.

In our choices, only 1 word is synonymous or related to "multiple nodes", which is in *a) "A computing task is distributed to several computers"*.

Therefore, our answer is a).

## What is Grid Computing


> [!quote] Grid computing is defined as a distributed architecture of multiple computers connected by networks that work together to accomplish a joint task. This system operates on a data grid where computers interact to coordinate jobs at hand.
