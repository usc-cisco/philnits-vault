d) It is necessary for B to make twice as much as the annual profit than that of A.

## Payout Period

The payout period, also known as the payback period, is calculated by dividing the initial investment **(money we pay for the equipment/materials)** by the annual cash flow **(how much the investment will make yearly)**.

For example, if we invest 1000 to buy computers and it makes us 200 every year, our payout period is $\frac{1000}{200} = 5 \space\text{years}$.

In our problem, we already have the payout period and the investment amount, so we can derive a new formula for the annual profit using algebraic manipulation.

$\frac{\text{investment}}{\text{annual income}} = years$

We multiply annual income from both sides to remove the denominator:

${\text{investment}} = \text{years} * \text{annual income}$

Then we isolate annual income by dividing both sides by $years$.

$\frac{\text{investment}}{\text{years}} = \text{annual income}$

## Step 1: Calculate the Annual Revenue Needed for A & B

> [!info] We need to find how much A & B has to make yearly to meet the amount of investment in their specified Payout Period.

- $A = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \space\text{per year}$
- $B = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \space\text{per year}$

Therefore, to meet the payout period, A needs to make 30 (in 10k yen) income annually and B needs to make 60 per year in order to meet their payout periods, assuming no interest.

## Step 2: Understanding the Question

The question is asking for the appropriate description for the "minimum amount of annual profit necessary to recover the amount of investment within the payout period".

It's asking us to find the proper answer that **describes our current payout period and investment calculations we made previously**.

## Step 3: Analyzing the Choices

### a) It is necessary for A and B to make the same amount of annual profit.

This can't be true because as we see from our calculations $30 \neq {60}$.

### b) It is necessary for A to make twice as much as the annual profit than that of B.

This is wrong because A needs to make half the annual profit of B.

### c) It is necessary for B to make 1.5 times as much as the annual profit than that of A.

This is also wrong, because if B made 1.5 times as much the annual profit of A, then B would need 45 annual profit, which does not line up with our calculations.

### d) It is necessary for B to make twice as much as the annual profit than that of A.

This is correct because B does indeed make twice as much the annual profit than A to meet the payout period.
