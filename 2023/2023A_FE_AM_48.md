Which of the following is approved by the customer when the external design of a system is completed?

a) Physical database specification
b) Program flowchart
c) Screen layout
d) System development plan
? 
c) Screen layout

When the external design of a system is completed, it typically involves creating the **user interface (UI)** and how the system will interact with the user.
- This is often referred to as the **external design** or **design specification**, which focuses on the appearance and interaction of the system from the user's perspective.
- The **screen layout** is part of this external design, as it defines how information will be presented to the user on different screens (e.g., forms, menus, buttons, etc.).

## Other Choices 

- **a) Physical database specification**:
    
    - This typically describes how the data will be stored physically in the system, including database structure and storage mechanisms, which is more related to the **internal design** rather than external design.
- **b) Program flowchart**:
    
    - A program flowchart is more related to the **internal design** of the system, as it represents the flow of control and logic within the program. It is concerned with how the system operates internally, not how it looks or interacts with the user.
- **d) System development plan**:
    
    - This is a project management document that outlines the timeline, resources, and schedule for the entire system development process, but it's not typically **approved by the customer** once the external design is completed. It is more of an overarching plan for development.
