Which of the following is a role that a PKI certification authority performs as a reliable third party?

a) It allocates a digital signature to an e-mail body by a user’s request. 
b) It enables to synchronize the time by returning an accurate time to a user’s request. 
c) It issues a digital certificate that certifies a private key of a user or a server. 
d) It issues a digital certificate that certifies a public key of a user or a server. 
? 
d) It issues a digital certificate that certifies a public key of a user or a server. 

### What is PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)?

**PKI** is a framework of technologies, policies, and procedures that enable secure communication over a network, especially the Internet, by using a combination of cryptographic keys (public and private keys). PKI provides mechanisms for:

- **Creating** and managing cryptographic key pairs (public and private keys).
- **Distributing** public keys securely.
- **Authenticating** the identity of entities (users, servers, devices) that use public key cryptography.
- **Ensuring** the integrity and non-repudiation of digital communications.

A central part of PKI is the **Certification Authority (CA)**, which acts as a **trusted third party** in verifying the authenticity of users, servers, or devices.

### Roles of a Certification Authority (CA) in PKI:

- **Issuing digital certificates**: The CA verifies the identity of the entity requesting a digital certificate (such as a user or server) and then issues a digital certificate. This certificate includes the entity’s public key and serves as proof that the public key belongs to that entity.
- **Verifying identity**: The CA ensures that the person or entity associated with the public key in the certificate is legitimate.
- **Signing digital certificates**: The CA uses its own private key to sign the digital certificate it issues, providing a mechanism for others to verify the certificate's authenticity using the CA's public key.

## PKI Flow
### 1. **Key Pair Generation**

- The process begins with a user (called a **subject**) or a server generating a **key pair**:
    - **Public Key**: Shared with others and used for encryption or verifying digital signatures.
    - **Private Key**: Kept secret by the owner and used for decryption or creating digital signatures.
- This key pair is essential to the **asymmetric encryption** process.

### 2. **Requesting a Digital Certificate (Certificate Signing Request - CSR)**

- The user or server generates a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**, which includes their **public key** and some identifying information (e.g., name, domain name, organization).
- The CSR is sent to a trusted third party called the **Certification Authority (CA)** for verification.

### 3. **Verification of Identity by the Certification Authority (CA)**

- The **CA** performs a verification process to ensure that the person or organization requesting the certificate is who they claim to be. This can include checking documents, performing background checks, or verifying domain ownership (for web servers).
- The CA acts as a **trusted third party**, confirming the identity of the certificate requester.

### 4. **Issuance of the Digital Certificate**

- Once the CA verifies the identity of the requester, it issues a **digital certificate**. The certificate contains:
    - The **public key** of the requester (user or server).
    - The identifying information of the requester.
    - The CA’s digital signature, which certifies the authenticity of the certificate.
- The digital certificate binds the requester’s **public key** to their identity and ensures others can trust that key.

### 5. **Distribution of the Digital Certificate**

- The issued **digital certificate** is returned to the requester.
- The **public key** and the certificate can now be freely shared with others. For example, in web servers, the digital certificate is installed on the server, allowing users to securely communicate with the server using the **public key**.

### 6. **Secure Communication Using the Public Key**

- When someone (a client or another server) wants to communicate securely with the certificate holder:
    - They use the **public key** from the digital certificate to **encrypt** data or verify the certificate holder’s **digital signature**.
- Only the certificate holder, who possesses the corresponding **private key**, can decrypt the data or create a valid digital signature.

### 7. **Verification of the Digital Certificate**

- When a client (e.g., a web browser) receives the digital certificate from a server, it needs to verify the certificate’s authenticity. This involves:
    - **Checking the CA’s signature**: The client verifies the CA’s digital signature on the certificate using the CA’s **public key** (which is usually pre-installed in the client’s trusted root certificate store).
    - **Validity checks**: The client also checks if the certificate is within its valid date range and if it has not been revoked.

### 8. **Revocation and Expiry of Certificates**

- Digital certificates have an **expiry date** (typically 1 or 2 years), after which they must be renewed or replaced.
- If a private key is compromised or other issues arise, the certificate can be **revoked**. The CA maintains a **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)** or uses the **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)** to allow others to check if a certificate has been revoked.

### 9. **Establishing Trust**

- Once the certificate is validated, the client can trust the server’s identity (or the user’s identity) and begin secure communication.
- For example, in HTTPS connections, a secure communication channel is established using protocols like **SSL/TLS**, where the server proves its identity using its digital certificate, and secure communication is established with encryption.
