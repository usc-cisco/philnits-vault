Which of the following is an appropriate description concerning corporate security management when Software as a Service (SaaS) is used?

a) No system access management needs to be performed, and no consideration concerning 
the procedure for password initialization or a password policy that satisfies complexity 
requirements is required. 
b) No system construction needs to be performed, and neither the definition of security 
requirements for application software development nor the design of storage volume for 
system logs is required. 
c) No system operation needs to be performed, and no consideration concerning work 
procedures at the time of a failure or backup is required. 
d) No system security management needs to be performed, and neither the creation of 
information security management rules nor the assignment of an administrator is 
required.
? 
b) No system construction needs to be performed, and neither the definition of security 
requirements for application software development nor the design of storage volume for 
system logs is required. 

## SaaS

> [!info] Software as a Service
> The software already exists and the company is leasing the service and utilizing pre-existing infrastructure and application code to perform various functions.

b) No system construction needs to be performed, and neither the definition of security 
requirements for application software development nor the design of storage volume for 
system logs is required. 

This is correct because we do not need to define the "application software development" nor "design of storage volume for system logs" because this is being done by the SaaS owner, and not the corporate business using the SaaS.

### What we should do when we use a SaaS?

What we do need to do is set security policies and backups if ever the SaaS fails in the future. Likewise, we should also define who will be managing the SaaS product in the company, so a) c), and d) are valid practices that we must not ignore when using a SaaS in the company.
