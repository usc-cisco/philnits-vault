As an example of the use of big data, which of the following is a process that uses statistical or other methods to obtain new knowledge (such as trends and patterns) from a large amount of data?

a) Data dictionary
b) Data mining
c) Data warehouse
d) Metadata
? 
b) Data mining


## Choices
### a) Data Dictionary

A **data dictionary** is a centralized repository that provides information about data, including its meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format. It’s more about defining data structures and ensuring consistency in data usage but does not involve analysis or the discovery of new knowledge from the data.

### b) Data Mining

**Data mining** is the process that uses statistical, mathematical, and artificial intelligence methods to analyze large datasets and extract new knowledge, such as patterns, trends, and correlations. It’s a key aspect of big data analytics that helps in making data-driven decisions and discovering insights from massive amounts of data.

### c) Data Warehouse

A **data warehouse** is a large, centralized repository where data is stored from multiple sources. It is typically used for reporting and analysis. The data in a warehouse is structured and organized for querying and analysis but does not directly provide new insights on its own; it supports data mining and other analytical processes.

### d) Metadata

**Metadata** refers to "data about data." It provides information such as when the data was created, by whom, its format, and other details that help in understanding and organizing data. Metadata doesn’t involve any discovery of new insights or patterns but is important for managing and using data efficiently.

### Summary

- **Data dictionary** and **metadata** are about organizing and defining data.
- **Data warehouse** is for storing and managing large datasets.
- **Data mining** is the process that actively extracts new knowledge, making it the right answer for your question.
