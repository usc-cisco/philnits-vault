## Choices 

### a) Cluster Configuration

- **Cluster configuration** refers to a setup where multiple servers (or nodes) work together to increase performance, reliability, or scalability. This can involve **load balancing** or **failover systems** to ensure that if one server fails, another takes over.
- **Why it's incorrect**: Cluster configuration is not directly related to security or inspecting data to block attacks. Its purpose is to improve system availability and performance, not to analyze or filter web traffic.

### b) Load Balancing Function

- **Load balancing** is a technique used to distribute network or application traffic across multiple servers. This ensures that no single server is overwhelmed with too many requests, improving the system's availability and responsiveness.
- **Why it's incorrect**: Load balancing helps with distributing traffic efficiently, but it does not analyze or block malicious attacks like SQL injection. It is focused on traffic distribution, not security inspection.

### c) SSL-VPN Function

- **SSL-VPN (Secure Sockets Layer Virtual Private Network)** is a technology used to provide secure remote access to a private network over the Internet. It uses **SSL/TLS encryption** to protect the data in transit, ensuring that communication between the client and the VPN server is secure.
- **Why it's incorrect**: SSL-VPN focuses on securing the communication channel by encrypting data, but it does not inspect the actual content of the traffic for malicious behavior, such as SQL injection. It ensures confidentiality but doesn't filter or block specific types of attacks.

### d) WAF (Web Application Firewall)

- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** is a security system specifically designed to monitor, filter, and block HTTP/HTTPS traffic to and from web applications. WAFs are used to protect web applications by inspecting incoming traffic for malicious patterns, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web application attacks.
- **How WAF works**: It acts as a filter, sitting between the client and the web server, analyzing the data and requests sent by the client. If it detects any malicious activity (such as a SQL injection attempt), it blocks the request before it reaches the server.
- **Why it's correct**: WAF is specifically designed to block attacks such as **SQL injection**, making it the correct choice for inspecting data and providing application-level protection.
