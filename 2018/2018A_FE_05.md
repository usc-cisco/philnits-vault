? 
d) ABCDEF

## Analyzing the Choices

### a) 456789

This cannot be possible because our regex expression requires `[A-Z]+`, meaning "one or more character from the range A-Z".

### b) ABC+99

This cannot be because we do not match for `+` characters. If we wanted to match for `+`, we need to escape it in the regular expression like `\+`.

### c) ABC99*

The same reasoning applied to b) works here, we should see a `\*` at the end if we want to match `*` characters.

### d) ABCDEF

This is correct because we can have zero or more numbers thanks to the `*` modifier for the `[0-9]` character range.
