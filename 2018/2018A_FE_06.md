Data A, B, C and D are entered as an input sequence. Which of the following is a 
possible output sequence by only using a single stack?

a) A, D, B, C
b) B, D, A, C
c) C, B, D, A
d) D, C, A, B
? 
c) C, B, D, A

## Analyzing the Problem

Since we only have a single stack, we can only push into it using the input sequence, or pop from it to create the output sequence.

## Why it's C) C, B, D, A

Let's say our stack is an empty array right now `{}`, where the last index indicates the top of the stack.

We push A, B, and C into the stack first.
- `{ A, B, C }`

Then if we want to achieve our pattern in C, we can pop C and B right now.
- `{ A }` and our output is `{ C, B }`

Then we can insert the last element in our input sequence.

- `{ A, D }`

Then we can pop all the characters into the output seqeunce.

- `{}` and the output is `{ C, B, D, A }`.

Therefore, the correct answer is **c) C, B, D, A**.
