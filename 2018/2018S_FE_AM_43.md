When malware that has made a successful intrusion into a PC communicates with a command-and-control server on the Internet, which of the following is a reason for using the TCP port number 80 as the destination port in most cases?
**a) Given that this port is used for browsing websites, there is a high probability that communication is allowed by the firewall. 
b) Given that this port is used for browsing websites through HTTPS communication, there is a low probability that this port is detected by an intrusion detection system. 
c) Given that this port is used for the name resolution of a domain name, there is a low probability that this port is detected by an intrusion detection system. 
d) Given that this port is used in a DNS zone transfer, there is a high probability that communication is allowed by the firewall.**
?
**a) Given that this port is used for browsing websites, there is a high probability that communication is allowed by the firewall.** 
### Explanation
This is because TCP port 80 is normally firewall friendly and is prone to administrative mismanagement. This means that packets sent and received from sources using this port often go unchecked, and goes undiscovered until manual inspection or another system flags the packets as suspicious. ඞඞඞ
