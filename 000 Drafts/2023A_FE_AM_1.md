# 2023A_FE_AM_1 %% ex. 2024S_FE-A_83 %%

In a school class, 13 students play basketball and 19 play football. Among them, 8 
students play both. Further, 7 students play neither. How many students are there in the 
class?

a) 17
b) 31
c) 33
d) 47
? 
b) 31
### Step 1: Create Venn Diagram with Student Numbers

We can create a [[Venn Diagram]] of all the sports and we firstly add the students in the union `Basketball v Football` then we add the students exclusive to their own sports and subtract the union students from them.

### Step 2: We Add the Students Together

$5 + 8 + 11 + 7 = 31$

So our final answer is 31.
