A vehicle travels along a circular path as shown in the figure below. Two sensors, _L_ and _R_, whose revolution speeds are independently controlled, are attached to the left and right rear wheels. Sensors _L_ and _R_ are photo-reflective sensors, and their values change according to the ratio of black and white regions they pass over. If the ratio increases, the sensor value decreases, and if the ratio decreases, the sensor value increases. Which of the following is an appropriate control to ensure that the vehicle travels along the black outline of the circle? Here, if the values of the two sensors are equal, the motor revolution speeds return to the initial values.
