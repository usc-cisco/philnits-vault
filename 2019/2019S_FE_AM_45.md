As shown in the figure below, an application on a client accesses the data of the database on a server via database connection programs. Which of the following is a measure for preventing the leakage of the commands and execution results transmitted between the application and database?

**a) Changing the port number from its initial value that the database connection programs use for communication in the database management system** 

**b) Encrypting the communication between the database connection programs** 

**c) Restricting the IP addresses of the clients that can access the database connection program on the server to only those that are required** 

**d) Setting a password for starting or stopping the database connection program on the server**
?
**b) Encrypting the communication between the database connection programs** 
## **Explanation:**

**Encrypting the communication between the database connection programs** is the most effective measure to prevent the leakage of commands and execution results transmitted between the application and the database. Encryption ensures that any data intercepted by an attacker while it is being transmitted is unreadable without the decryption key, thereby protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a) Changing the port number from its initial value that the database connection programs use for communication in the database management system**: While this may reduce the likelihood of automated attacks, it does not secure the data being transmitted.
- **c) Restricting the IP addresses of the clients that can access the database connection program on the server to only those that are required**: This enhances security by limiting access but does not protect the data in transit.
- **d) Setting a password for starting or stopping the database connection program on the server**: This measure protects the database connection program itself but does not address the protection of data during transmission.

In summary, encryption is the key measure for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the client application and the database server.
