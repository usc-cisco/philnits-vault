How many four-digit decimal numbers are made from four (4) different digits between 0 and 9? Here, a four-digit decimal number has a non-zero leading digit.

**a) 4320**
**b) 4436**
**c) 4536**
**d) 5040**
?
**c) 4536**
## **Explanation:**
We need to calculate how many **four-digit decimal numbers** can be made from **four different digits** between 0 and 9, ensuring that the **leading digit is non-zero**.
1. **First digit**: The leading digit must be from 1 to 9 (9 choices).
2. **Second digit**: This can be any of the 9 remaining digits (including 0 but excluding the first digit).
3. **Third digit**: This can be any of the remaining 8 digits.
4. **Fourth digit**: This can be any of the remaining 7 digits.

So, the total number of possible four-digit numbers is:
#### $$9~\times~9~\times~8~\times~7=4536$$
Therefore, the answer is **c)**.
