Which of the following is an appropriate activity that is undertaken by a system auditor who audits access control? 

**a) Confirmation of the management status of the access control concerning the data** 

**b) Creation and storage of a management table for the access control concerning the software** 

**c) Establishment of a management policy for the access control concerning the network** 

**d) Implementation of the operations management for the access control concerning the hardware**
?
**a) Confirmation of the management status of the access control concerning the data** 
## **Explanation:**

Auditing access control primarily involves evaluating how access to systems and data is managed, ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific resources. The auditor’s role is to assess the effectiveness of existing access control measures and their alignment with organizational policies and compliance requirements.

**Confirmation of the management status of access control concerning data** means that the auditor verifies and evaluates how access rights and permissions are granted, monitored, and reviewed for data access. This involves checking whether:

- Access controls are properly defined and documented.
- User permissions align with their job roles.
- There are processes for regular review of access rights.
- Any changes to access rights are appropriately authorized and recorded.

### Overview of Other Options

- **b)** Creation and storage of a management table for the access control concerning the software: This activity is more of a management function than an auditing function. The auditor should evaluate such tables rather than create them.
    
- **c)** Establishment of a management policy for the access control concerning the network: This is typically a responsibility of management or IT security professionals rather than the auditor. The auditor reviews existing policies rather than creating them.
    
- **d)** Implementation of the operations management for the access control concerning the hardware: Like option **c**, this falls under the domain of management or operational roles. The auditor assesses the implementation and effectiveness of such controls instead of executing them.

In summary, option **a** is the correct activity for a system auditor auditing access control, as it focuses on verifying the effectiveness and management of access controls regarding data, which is a critical component of an auditor's responsibilities.
