Which of the following is a description of a brute force attack by which an attempt is made to find the key of private key cryptography? 

**a) Finding the key by observing the ciphertext change when the plaintext is changed by a certain amount** 

**b) Finding the key by testing all key combinations sequentially when a set of plaintext and ciphertext is given** 

**c) Finding the key by using as a clue the algebraic expression representing the relationship between the plaintext, ciphertext, and key** 

**d) Finding the key by using as a clue the statistical correlation between a part of the information of the plaintext and part of the information of the ciphertext**
?
**b) Finding the key by testing all key combinations sequentially when a set of plaintext and ciphertext is given** 
## **Explanation:**

A **brute force attack** on private key cryptography involves systematically trying every possible key combination until the correct key is found. This method does not rely on any knowledge about the plaintext or ciphertext beyond what is required to confirm whether a guessed key produces the correct decryption.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a)** Describes a method related to **differential cryptanalysis**, where changes in plaintext lead to changes in ciphertext.
- **c)** Describes a method related to **algebraic attacks**, where the attacker uses mathematical relationships to derive the key.
- **d)** Describes a method related to **statistical attacks**, where the attacker exploits patterns in plaintext and ciphertext to determine the key.

Thus, option **b** is the most accurate description of a brute force attack.
