When a developmental process of utilizing big data is classified into the four (4) stages below, which of the following is an example that corresponds to the fourth stage? 

- [Developmental stages of big data utilization] 
	- Stage 1: Confirmation of facts in the past and present (what was it before?) 
	- Stage 2: Interpretation of the past and present status (why have/had it be so?) 
	- Stage 3: Prediction of the occurrence of a possible event in the future (what is it likely to be?) 
	- Stage 4: Development into a future activity (what should be done?) 
	
**a) Based on the analysis results of the big data in which the operation histories of many users are stored, the operational errors and their causes that were not anticipated by the manufacturer at first are found.** 

**b) Based on the big data, cases of operational errors made by users and increase in the failure rate due to such cases are estimated and the user interface is improved to make it less likely to cause operational errors.** 

**c) By using a simulation that uses big data, an increase in the failure rate of a product is estimated when an operational error supposed occurs repeatedly.** 

**d) By using the Internet access function of a product, the operation histories of many users of the product are stored in big data, and the rate of using functions is clarified after the product is sold.**
?
**b) Based on the big data, cases of operational errors made by users and increase in the failure rate due to such cases are estimated and the user interface is improved to make it less likely to cause operational errors.** 
## **Explanation:**

In the context of the developmental stages of big data utilization, **Stage 4** focuses on taking action based on insights gained from data analysis to influence future activities. Option **b** aligns with this stage because it involves estimating the impact of operational errors and proactively improving the user interface to prevent future issues. This reflects a commitment to using data-driven insights to inform decisions and enhance the user experience.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) Based on the analysis results of the big data in which the operation histories of many users are stored, the operational errors and their causes that were not anticipated by the manufacturer at first are found.**  
    This option corresponds more closely to **Stage 2**, where past errors are analyzed to understand their causes, rather than taking future-oriented actions.
    
- **c) By using a simulation that uses big data, an increase in the failure rate of a product is estimated when an operational error supposed occurs repeatedly.**  
    This option relates to **Stage 3**, as it involves predicting future failure rates based on simulated scenarios rather than developing future activities.
    
- **d) By using the Internet access function of a product, the operation histories of many users of the product are stored in big data, and the rate of using functions is clarified after the product is sold.**  
    This option describes the collection and analysis of data about product usage but does not involve any actionable insights or improvements based on that data, making it more aligned with **Stage 1** or **Stage 2**.
    

In summary, option **b** is the best example of Stage 4, as it demonstrates the application of big data insights to improve user interface design and reduce operational errors in the future.
