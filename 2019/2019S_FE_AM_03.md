**a) -3** 

**b) 0** 

**c) 3** 

**d) 40/3**
? 
**b) 0**
## **Explanation:**

If the arithmetic expression is in **postfix notation**, then the operators come **after** the operands. Find 2 operands that has an operator **after** them. Then perform the operation according to the operator. Repeat until you get the result. In this problem, substitute the variables with their respective values first before solving the expression.
