An attacker captures unencrypted network traffic with a tool and later analyzes it offline to learn about the information contained in those transmissions. Which of the following is this attack? 

**a) Buffer overflow attack** 

**b) Phishing attack** 

**c) Smurf attack** 

**d) Sniffing attack**
?
**d) Sniffing attack**
## **Explanation:**

A **sniffing attack** involves capturing and analyzing network traffic as it travels across a network. Attackers use tools called packet sniffers to intercept unencrypted data packets, which may contain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. Once the attacker has captured this data, they can analyze it offline to extract useful information.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a) Buffer overflow attack**: This attack exploits vulnerabilities in a program by overflowing a buffer to execute arbitrary code or crash the program.
- **b) Phishing attack**: This is a social engineering attack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to trick users into providing sensitive information, typically via email or fraudulent websites.
- **c) Smurf attack**: This is a type of DDoS attack where an attacker sends ICMP echo requests to a network's broadcast address, causing all devices on the network to respond to a targeted victim, overwhelming it with traffic.

Therefore, the appropriate classification for the described scenario is **d) Sniffing attack**.
