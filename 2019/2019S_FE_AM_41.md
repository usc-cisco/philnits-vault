Which of the following is an encryption algorithm for public key cryptography? 

Which of the following is a security attack that prevents users from accessing their accounts? 

**a) Brute force** 

**b) Denial of Service** 

**c) Man in the middle** 

**d) Sniffing**
?
**b) Denial of Service**  
## **Explanation:**

A **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack aims to make a system or service unavailable to its intended users, effectively preventing them from accessing their accounts. This can be achieved by overwhelming the server with requests, causing legitimate users to be unable to access the service.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **a) Brute Force**: This attack involves attempting to guess passwords or encryption keys by trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found. It does not inherently prevent access; instead, it attempts to gain access.
- **c) Man in the Middle**: This attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, allowing them to eavesdrop or alter the communication. It does not directly prevent users from accessing their accounts but compromises the security of their communication.
- **d) Sniffing**: This is the act of capturing network traffic to intercept data packets, often used to gather information like passwords. It doesn't prevent access but can lead to unauthorized access if sensitive information is obtained.

Thus, the most appropriate option for an attack that prevents users from accessing their accounts is the **Denial of Service** attack.
