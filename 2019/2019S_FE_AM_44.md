Which of the following is the technique of actually attempting an attack and intrusion on a system to detect the security-related vulnerabilities of a computer or network? 

**a) Penetration test** 

**b) Regression test** 

**c) Software inspection** 

**d) Walk-through**
?
**a) Penetration test**
## **Explanation:**

A **penetration test** (or pen test) is a simulated cyber attack against a computer system, network, or web application to identify security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. The goal is to assess the security posture of the system and provide recommendations for improving security measures.

### Overview of Other Options:

- **b) Regression test**: This is a type of software testing that ensures that recent changes or updates to a program do not negatively affect its existing functionality.
- **c) Software inspection**: This is a formal process of examining software artifacts (like requirements, design, or code) to identify defects, ensure quality, and improve the development process.
- **d) Walk-through**: This is a review process in software development where a developer explains the logic of their code to peers or stakeholders to gather feedback and identify potential issues.

Therefore, the appropriate classification for the technique described is **a) Penetration test**.
