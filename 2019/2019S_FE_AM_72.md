Which of the following is a description of CGM (Consumer Generated Media)? 

**a) It allows the customers of a company who want to join a mailing list to register on it and periodically receive information via e-mail.**

?
**b) It enables the delivery of the digital contents prepared by an individual to a viewer or audience and its sharing between the users.** 
## **Explanation:**

**Consumer Generated Media (CGM)** refers to content created and shared by individuals rather than professional media producers. This can include blog posts, videos, social media updates, reviews, and any other form of digital content that consumers create and share with others. The emphasis is on user-generated content that is distributed across various platforms, allowing for interaction and sharing among users.

### Overview of Other Options

- **a) It allows the customers of a company who want to join a mailing list to register on it and periodically receive information via e-mail.**  
    This describes a mailing list or newsletter subscription, which does not encompass the broader concept of CGM.
    
- **c) It offers functions for trading goods in an auction format and works as an intermediary for the consumers in personal trading.**  
    This refers to online auction platforms or marketplaces (like eBay) rather than CGM, which is focused on content creation.
    
- **d) It provides a common ground for online shops of individual storekeepers and takes over the tasks of issuing common points and settling credit card payments.**  
    This describes an e-commerce platform or marketplace for individual sellers, which again is not related to CGM.
    

In summary, option **b** accurately captures the essence of CGM as it highlights the creation and sharing of digital content by consumers, enabling delivery to an audience.
